# Tic Tac Toe (revisited)

Roughly nine months ago, I made the Tic Tac Toe project for The Odin Project.
I want to try doing it again without looking at the code I wrote back then.

### Objective

The goal of the project is to practice JavaScript and become more familiar with
OOP and project building. This includes writing down user stories, features,
flowcharts, architecture, and

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to play Tic Tac Toe with another user
- As a user, I want to clearly see the winning row, column, or diagonal
- As a user, I want to clearly know when a draw has been reached
- As a user, I want to launch a new game after the game has concluded

### Features

- The game can be played on the same computer
- A win results in the winning line to show up more obviously
- A draw results in dimming of all squares and player names
- A modal window offers a rematch when a conclusion is reached
- The new game starts without page relaod
- Squares light up when the mouse hovers over them
- Squares give an impression of depth when clicked
- Clicking on the page reopens the modal window (if originally declined)
- The page indicates whose turn it is to play

### Flowchart

Page Loads -> Board is created -> Two players are created -> X starts
-> players alternate -> clicking on an occupied square doesn't rewrite
nor does it switch players -> winner/draw is identified -> rematch offered ->
board cleared -> new game starts

### Architecture

Class Game

constructor() {

- Board [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
- Player 1
- Player 2
- currentPlayer  
  }

- init()
- offerRematch()
- clearBoard()
- printBoard()
- switchPlayer()
- declareOutcome(verdict)
- checkWin()
- playToken(position)
- simulateGame()

Class Player

constructor() {

- number
- token  
  }

## Reflection

### Lessons & Difficulties

Formatting README.md is a pain.

### Diary

I look forward to learning more about Test Drive Development. My friend found a
bug that I should anticipated but hadn't. If I had thought more deliberately
about all likely scenarios, I would have anticipated it (with the proper tests).
